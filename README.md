<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I would like to present to you a program for viewing, comparing, creating and extracting files from BAR archives of the Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition (also supports AoE3 2007). This tool replaces the AoE3Ed Viewer developed by Ykkrosh, which does not work for the Definitive Edition.
The updated version includes all **(x)** functions that were in AoE3Ed Viewer, as well as new features:

**Preview:**
* Syntax highlighting in previewing text files (xml, xs).
* Search in preview in text files (CTRL + F).
* Ability to scale and drag images in preview.

**Entries table:**
* Grouping files by their format (optional).
* Sort by name, size, creation date.
* Search in the BAR archive.
* Calculation of CRC (optional).
* The size of the selected entries.
* Detail of entry file.

**Conversion:**
* Converting XML <-> XMB (both 2007 and DE).
* Converting DDT -> PNG.

**Extract:**
* Extract all files.
* Extract selected files.

**Other:**
* Comparison of BAR archives.
* Create BAR archive from files and folders.


**(x) Currently the application does not include the following features:**
* Converting DDT <-> TGA (it is recommended to use [Photoshop Plugin by kangcliff](http://aoe3.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/display.cgi?action=ct&f=14,39229,,10)).

## Latest Changes

### Version 0.4
* Added decryption of sounds (sound files can be extracted without problem now).
* Added new GUI for extraction dialog.
* Fixed bug with .xmb.xml extension while converted.
* Added entry details window (in context menu in entries table).
